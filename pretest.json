		        "a": "Parity error checking uses XOR (⊕) to detect if the number of 1s, including the parity bit, is even or odd. The expression x ⊕ y ⊕ z ⊕ P correctly verifies this condition.",

		        "a": "",
		        "b": "When an error occurs, the XOR of all data bits and the parity bit becomes 1, indicating a parity mismatch. A result of 1 signals the presence of an error.",
